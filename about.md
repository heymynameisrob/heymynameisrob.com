My name is Rob. I've been designing professinally for around 6 years. I work at [nuom](https://nuom.co.uk), where I lead the product team to help our partners design and ship great products. 

I also work on some side-projects, such as Deal Delivers. I worked with these guys to create an online directory of local services that delivered to people during the coronavirus pandemic. This not only helped people access vital services, but also help keep local businesses afloat â€“ which made us feel pretty good about ourselves.

I live in Nottingham, which is a small, leafy city in the heart of England. You've probably heard of Robin Hood right? Merry men and all that? That's where he's from. I live here with my fiancÃ© Harriet, who is a nurse, and my rabbit Daisy who eats a lot of hay.

I love to spend my free-time cycling and walking around England. I also collect a lot of records, read a lot, drink craft beers and love spaghetti westerns. 

I don't really 'do' social media much anymore. If you want to stay in touch with what I'm doing professinally, you can read my blogs on this site or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/robhough182).
