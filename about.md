I live in Nottingham, which is a small, leafy city in the heart of England. You've probably heard of Robin Hood right? Merry men and all that? That's where he's from. I live here with my fiancé Harriet, who is a nurse, and my rabbit Daisy who eats a lot of hay.

I grew in Leicester in the 90's. My dad worked in a factory and my mum had bounced between being a housewife and various odd-jobs. Around 95, my dad was promoted from the factory floor into head office. This meant he needed computer skills, so we eventually got a computer in the house. It was a very expensive toy that I was interested in. At some point, I found an book a battered, daisy yellow on HTML and how to build websites. From then on, all I cared about was messing around with that computer.

When I was 16 I left school to get a crappy job in a printing factory. I would pack boxes. I would put boxes on shipments. I would have to make the tea. Because I could use the computer,  I also got to create spec sheets, artwork and stuff. I got paid £3.75/hour and I had a VW Polo where only one door worked. I spent all my money on records, weed and skateboarding trips. Life was good. 

I spent most of my summers skating and hanging around with my friends. I was still messing around with HTML and design in the evenings. I started to make websites for local buisnesses and help them with SEO for some beer money. I didn't think there was much else to it.

After a while, I got sick of working in a dead end job with people twice my age. I looked around at what I was qualified for and realised that I didn't have anything but a few GCSE's to my name – so I decided to try and go back to college to do my A levels. Whilst looking at colleges, I found this thing called 'design'. You could actually learn how to design things; logos, websites, apps etc. I never knew this thing existed. I saw this as my way out. I spent nearly a year putting together a portfolio and got reject from more colleges than I care to admit. But eventually, City & Islington College and London Univserity took a gamble on me and I enrolled into Digital Design FdA. 

Throughout my 3 years studying, I worked multiple jobs includind freelance design jobs – mostly on eCommerce sites. Afterwards, I came back home to Leicester for 6 months to work in an eCommerce shop. I knew I couldn't afford to compete in the rat race of unpaid internships in the most expensive city in Europe. My parents didn't give me a trust fund to rely on, so I make some tax-avoiding marketing agency a bunch of money. 

The first design job I had was a huge experience. I saw what a good designer *should do* and also importantly what they *shouldn't do*. I was taken under the wing of a guy called Alex who was the creative director. He showed me how to work with clients, present work and also make judgement calls on what to do. I eventually moved back to London when I had enough cash and worked for a branding agency, [WeLaunch](https://welaunch.co.uk).

Since then I've worked for multiple companies both in-house and agency. Now I lead design at [nuom](https://nuom.co.uk). I've spent most of my career working on early-stage projects with little to no resources. On a small, cross-functional team without a pot to piss in. When you have to make something out of nothing and it was needed yesterday. For me, that's where I feel I am most effective and where my skills deliver the most value.

Design and tech has been my key interest and hobby since I was 14 years old. It's kinda odd when one of your hobbies becomes your work. It's an amazing privelege to do something you love for a living but you also realise that it's hard to find other passions outside of work. However, I do like to do other stuff.

I live in Nottingham with my girlfriend, Harriet and my rabbit, Daisy. I like to spend a lot of time hiking around Britian. I love walking and we're so spoilt being surrounded by breath-taking countryside. I also collect records. I inehrited a bunch from family members when I was in my late teens and have been obsessed ever since. I'm a big fan of craft beer, spagehetti westerns and passionately follow Leicester City FC.

I don't really 'do' social media much anymore. If you want to stay in touch with what I'm doing professinally, you can read my blogs on this site or connect with me on LinkedIn.
