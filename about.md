I live in Nottingham, which is a small, leafy city in the heart of England. You've probably heard of Robin Hood right? Merry men and all that? That's where he's from. I live here with my fianc√© Harriet, who is a nurse, and my rabbit Daisy who eats a lot of hay.


I love to spend my free-time cycling and walking around England. I also collect a lot of records, read a lot, drink craft beers and love spaghetti westerns.

I don't really 'do' social media much anymore. If you want to stay in touch with what I'm doing professinally, you can read my blogs on this site or connect with me on LinkedIn.
