I've been designing products for about 8 years. I also like to mentor, write and host my podcast [Found It](https://founditpodcast.com). I'm current Head of Design at [nuom](https://nuom.co.uk), a boutique studio working with early-stage startups.

At nuom I lead a team of 3 designers. I work with a cross-functional team and startup founders to validate product ideas, ship high-quality software and advise them on how to optimise products for their customers. I work with a range of talented and brilliant designers, engineers, and project managers to help founders grow their business and deliver huge value to their customers.

I believe design can help businesses "see around corners". Using good design practice, businesses can reduce risk, validate their decisions, and think more creatively. Design enables businesses to grow at rapid rates whilst also bringing a more human touch to their products.

I live in Nottingham, which is a small, leafy city in the heart of England. When I've logged off, I like to go hiking, collect records and hang out with my girlfriend and my rabbit.
