  <h1>Hey, I'm Rob ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>I work at <a href="https://nuom.co.uk">nuom</a>, where I lead the product team to help our partners build and ship great products.
  I've worked all over the place but now I mostly focus on working with early-stage startups or enterprises looking to innovate. 
  I also (try to) write a lot about my journey on becoming a design leader, as well as tech and product.</p>
