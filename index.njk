<h1>Hey my name is Rob ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I'm a product designer and writer based in the UK. Currently, I'm leading design at <a href="https://nuom.co.uk">nuom</a>, a product and startup studio, where I spend most of my time building new products and ventures with early-stage founders. I'm also the co-host of <a href="https://founditpodcast.com">Found It Podcast</a>, a podcast all about early-stage startup stories.</p>
<p>On the side, I also work on open-source projects like <a href="https://dealdelivers.com">Deal Delivers</a>, an open resource for local delivery services during the pandemic. I love to spend my free-time cycling and walking around England. I also collect a lot of records, read a lot, drink craft beers and love spaghetti westerns.</p>
